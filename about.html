	<p class="home-text">I made my dad teach me how to play a computer game when I was five. Eventually, the insides of that mysterious gray box grabbed my attention, and playing turned to tinkering. I had to know how it worked.</p>
	<p class="home-text">Physics taught me about basic digital building blocks and how thermodynamics demands that computers function as space heaters. When I came across quantum mechanics -- the ironclad laws of the very small -- I was smitten. In graduate school I studied how to harness these quantum rules to make new kinds of computers. But as my focus narrowed, my curiosity expanded, and my devotion to a scientific career became uncertain.</p>
	<p class="home-text">Now I will satisfy that curiosity by telling science stories. No longer focused solely on quantum physics, I will probe what we know and how we know it.</p>
