Welcome to my Jekyll-ified website. It's been in the making for more than a year, punctuated by two major bursts of activity.

I usually update my portfolio of published clips within a day of a story going live. This became a major hassle while I was a reporter for Nature, churning out news regularly. I had a massive <code>clips.html</code> file that I edited manually, and the whole thing became a tangled mess of <code>div</code> and <code>href</code> tags. There was a lot of hunting and indenting and copying and pasting. And I made lots of mistakes.

I also wanted to make my site responsive, so that visitors on mobile devices weren't left in the paleolithic pinch-and-zoom era.
