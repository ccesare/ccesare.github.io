In my last---and only---update, I wrote about moving my site to the Jekyll static site generator. That's been a great success, and it's really simplified the way I keep track of my published clips.

<div id="cell1"></div>

It's had a secondary effect, too. After rewriting my personal site to use Jekyll, I used it for a project at work

<script src="/assets/js/blogs/observable-notebooks.js" />
